Portifox
========

An application to check the inbounds and outbounds ships (cruisers, ferryboat etc..) of Civitavecchia's port.  

The app was developed during the FirefoxOS Day in Rome.  
The app doesn't work at all, because the webservice used is private can't be released for 3rd parties, yet.  
Because of this problem, during the hackaton, the URL of the webservice was replaced by an index.php, implemented to be a proxy for the webservice.  

We are working to create a stub for the webservice to make it works....
